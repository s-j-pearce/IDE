# IDE
### What is an IDE:
An IDE or Integrated development environment is an application or web based environment that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.
### Examples of IDE: 
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Oracle Netbeans
* Eclipse
* Aptana Studio 
* Repl.it
### Diffrence between using an IDE and not:
For our first project we used notepad in order to write our code. As Notepad is not an IDE it did not have any features to help us code. You would have to write the code and then save it to then be opened within ainternet browser. This can be a problem as sometimes the browser may not have the correct software installed or add-ons in order to preview your application in the desired way. Some features that you add in your code may not even be able to be seen on some browsers due to lack of compatibility.

In comparison, we used Repl.it for our second project to code. Repl.it is an online browser based IDE, it has basic functions and abilites that an IDE provides, it also allows the user to code in a large amount of different languages. Repl.it allowed us to view our application within the web page by just the click of a button. All you would need to do is write your code and when you want to test it, you click save then run and it will preview the application on the side, this was very helpful when developing our applications. Immediately we were able to notie the difference and the improvement between using an IDE and just a basic text editor.
